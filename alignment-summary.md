# Jira Cloud MCP Tool Consolidation Alignment Summary

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Request Schemas**
   - Replaced old schema definitions with consolidated tool schemas
   - Aligned schema names with tool names (e.g., `GetJiraIssueSchema` for `get_jira_issue`)
   - Added proper type exports for all schemas

2. **Updated Response Structure**
   - Modified `BaseFormatter` to use underscore prefixes for metadata and summary sections
   - Changed response structure from `metadata`/`summary` to `_metadata`/`_summary` to match the refactoring document

3. **Updated Documentation**
   - Updated README-tool-consolidation.md to reflect the new response structure
   - Ensured examples use the correct field names with underscore prefixes

## Remaining Work

1. **Update Handler Implementations**
   - The handlers in `src/handlers/` need to be updated to use the new response structure
   - References to `metadata` and `summary` should be changed to `_metadata` and `_summary`

2. **Consistent Parameter Naming**
   - Consider standardizing on either snake_case or camelCase for parameters
   - Currently, the code has normalization functions to handle both, but a consistent approach would be better

3. **Testing**
   - Test all tools with real Jira instances to ensure they work correctly
   - Verify that all expansions work as expected
   - Test error handling and edge cases

4. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update API reference documentation
   - Create more examples for common use cases
   - Add diagrams to illustrate the new architecture

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Parameter Naming Convention**
   - Standardize on snake_case for all parameters in the public API
   - Use camelCase internally in the code
   - Keep the normalization functions to support both for backward compatibility

2. **Response Structure**
   - Ensure all formatters use the `_metadata` and `_summary` fields consistently
   - Update any code that accesses these fields to use the new names

3. **Error Handling**
   - Enhance error messages to be more descriptive and helpful
   - Include suggestions for fixing common errors

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Add caching for frequently accessed data
   - Optimize batch requests for related data
   - Implement more efficient pagination

## Next Steps

1. Update all handler implementations to use the new response structure
2. Run comprehensive tests to ensure everything works correctly
3. Update the API reference documentation
4. Consider implementing the performance optimizations

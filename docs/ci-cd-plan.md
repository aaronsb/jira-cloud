# CI/CD Plan for Jira Cloud MCP

## Current Status

We've implemented a dual path build approach:
1. **Local Development**: Scripts for building and running locally
   - `scripts/build-local.sh`: Builds the project and Docker image locally
   - `scripts/run-local.sh`: Runs the Docker container with necessary environment variables

2. **GitHub Actions**: Workflow for CI/CD
   - Currently tries to run tests, build and push Docker images, and perform integration tests

## Observations

- We're not running actual tests against the Atlassian API, just mocks
- Full CI/CD might be overkill for this project at its current stage
- The current workflow is complex and might be more than what's needed

## Simplified Approach

### 1. Continuous Delivery Focus

Instead of full CI/CD, we could focus on Continuous Delivery:
- Build and package the MCP server
- Push to container registry when changes are merged to main
- Skip extensive testing until we have meaningful tests

### 2. Testing Strategy

Develop a testing strategy that makes sense for an MCP server:
- **Unit Tests**: Test individual handlers and utility functions
- **Mock Tests**: Test against mock Jira API responses
- **Integration Tests**: Optional tests against a real Jira instance (could be run manually or on a schedule)

### 3. Simplified GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Build and Publish

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    tags: [ 'v*' ]

env:
  REGISTRY: ghcr.io
  IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
    
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
      
      - name: Log in to GitHub Container Registry
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          registry: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      
      - name: Extract metadata for Docker
        id: meta
        uses: docker/metadata-action@v5
        with:
          images: ${{ env.REGISTRY }}/${{ env.IMAGE_NAME }}
          tags: |
            type=ref,event=branch
            type=semver,pattern={{version}}
            type=sha,format=long
      
      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.tags }}
          labels: ${{ steps.meta.outputs.labels }}
          cache-from: type=gha
          cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
          platforms: linux/amd64,linux/arm64
```

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Develop Meaningful Tests

- Create unit tests for handlers and utility functions
- Develop mock tests for Jira API interactions
- Consider integration tests with a test Jira instance

### 2. Versioning Strategy

- Implement semantic versioning
- Automate version bumping based on commit messages
- Tag releases appropriately

### 3. Documentation

- Improve documentation on how to use the MCP server
- Document the API and available tools
- Create examples of how to use the MCP server with different LLMs

### 4. Monitoring and Logging

- Add monitoring capabilities
- Improve logging for better debugging
- Consider adding telemetry for usage statistics

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**
   - Simplify GitHub Actions workflow
   - Fix any remaining build issues
   - Document the current state and usage

2. **Medium-term (1-2 months)**
   - Develop unit tests for core functionality
   - Implement mock tests for Jira API
   - Improve documentation

3. **Long-term (3+ months)**
   - Consider integration tests with real Jira instance
   - Implement monitoring and telemetry
   - Refine CI/CD based on project needs

## Conclusion

A simplified approach focusing on Continuous Delivery rather than full CI/CD makes more sense for this project at its current stage. As the project matures and more meaningful tests are developed, we can gradually enhance the CI/CD pipeline to include more comprehensive testing and validation.

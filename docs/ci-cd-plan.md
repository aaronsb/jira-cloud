# CI/CD Plan for Jira Cloud MCP

## Current Status

We've implemented a streamlined build approach:
1. **Local Development**: Scripts for building and running locally
   - `scripts/build-local.sh`: Builds the project and Docker image locally
   - `scripts/run-local.sh`: Runs the Docker container with necessary environment variables

2. **GitHub Actions**: Simplified workflow for CI/CD
   - Focuses on essential steps: lint, test, build code, build container
   - Mirrors the local build script approach for consistency

## Implemented Changes

We've simplified the CI/CD workflow to focus on the essential steps:

1. **Build and Test Job**:
   - Install dependencies
   - Run linting
   - Run unit tests
   - Build TypeScript code

2. **Build Container Job**:
   - Build and push Docker container
   - Tag appropriately based on branch/tag
   - Clean up old container versions

The workflow now closely resembles our local build script, providing consistency between local and CI environments.

## Current GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, ci-improvements ]
    tags: [ 'v*' ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

env:
  REGISTRY: ghcr.io
  IMAGE_NAME: ${{ github.repository }}

jobs:
  build-and-test:
    name: Build and Test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:

```

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Develop Meaningful Tests

- Create unit tests for handlers and utility functions
- Develop mock tests for Jira API interactions
- Consider integration tests with a test Jira instance

### 2. Versioning Strategy

- Implement semantic versioning
- Automate version bumping based on commit messages
- Tag releases appropriately

### 3. Documentation

- Improve documentation on how to use the MCP server
- Document the API and available tools
- Create examples of how to use the MCP server with different LLMs

### 4. Monitoring and Logging

- Add monitoring capabilities
- Improve logging for better debugging
- Consider adding telemetry for usage statistics

## Implementation Timeline

1. **Short-term (1-2 weeks)**
   - Simplify GitHub Actions workflow
   - Fix any remaining build issues
   - Document the current state and usage

2. **Medium-term (1-2 months)**
   - Develop unit tests for core functionality
   - Implement mock tests for Jira API
   - Improve documentation

3. **Long-term (3+ months)**
   - Consider integration tests with real Jira instance
   - Implement monitoring and telemetry
   - Refine CI/CD based on project needs

## Conclusion

A simplified approach focusing on Continuous Delivery rather than full CI/CD makes more sense for this project at its current stage. As the project matures and more meaningful tests are developed, we can gradually enhance the CI/CD pipeline to include more comprehensive testing and validation.

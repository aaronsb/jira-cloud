# Product Context

## Purpose
This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Jira Cloud integration, enabling seamless interaction with Jira's issue tracking and project management capabilities through the MCP protocol.

## Problems Solved
1. Standardized Jira Integration
   - Provides a consistent interface for Jira Cloud operations
   - Handles authentication and API complexities
   - Manages rate limiting and error handling

2. Enhanced Functionality
   - Rich issue management capabilities
   - Project and board operations
   - Search and filtering
   - Status transitions
   - Comment management
   - Attachment handling

3. Type Safety and Validation
   - Strong TypeScript typing
   - JSON Schema validation
   - Consistent error handling

## Expected Behavior
The server should:
1. Authenticate with Jira Cloud using provided credentials
2. Execute Jira operations through type-safe methods
3. Validate all inputs using JSON schemas
4. Handle errors gracefully with meaningful messages
5. Manage API rate limits and connectivity issues
6. Format responses consistently for MCP clients
